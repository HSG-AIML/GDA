    """Resample the weights of the patch embedding kernel to target resolution.
    We resample the patch embedding kernel by approximately inverting the effect
    of patch resizing.

    Code based on:
      https://github.com/google-research/big_vision/blob/b00544b81f8694488d5f36295aeb7972f3755ffe/big_vision/models/proj/flexi/vit.py

    With this resizing, we can for example load a B/8 filter into a B/16 model
    and, on 2x larger input image, the result will match.

    Args:
        patch_embed: original parameter to be resized.
        new_size (tuple(int, int): target shape (height, width)-only.
        interpolation (str): interpolation for resize
        antialias (bool): use anti-aliasing filter in resize
        verbose (bool): log operation
    Returns:
        Resized patch embedding kernel.
